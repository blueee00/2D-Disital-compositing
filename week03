## 1. What is Gamma? 
click [here](https://www.cambridgeincolour.com/tutorials/gamma-correction.htm) [reference_Gamma]

<u>**The relationship between a pixel's numerical value and its actual luminance.**</u>

- It's also referred to as **gamma correction, gamma encoding or gamma compression**

### 1.1. Why Gamma is used?
	- translating between our eye's light sensitivity and that of the camera. When a digital image is saved, it's therefore "gamma encoded"
	- the gamma encoded gradient distributes the tones roughly evenly across the entire range ("perceptually uniform").
 
 ### 1.2. Linear-Workflow

- **Image Gamma** :  making the most efficient use of a given bit depth. (ex)jpeg file)
- **Display Gamma**: the image isn't unrealistically brightened on our screen.( A higher display gamma results in a darker image with greater contrast.)
- **System Gamma**: A straight line makes that the input (the original scene) is the same as the output (the light displayed on screen or in a print).

## 2. What is the ACES(The Academy Color Encoding System)?

**the industry standard for managing color throughout the life cycle of a motion picture or television production.**

- includes everything the human eye can see, meaning there are no restrictions or limitations of the color space.
- <u>To reign in all the various formats and codecs.</u>

**An alpha channel** is an <u>image mask</u> that controls the visibility of a layer. 
Usually **white** means <u>opaque</u> and **black** means <u>transparent.</u>
